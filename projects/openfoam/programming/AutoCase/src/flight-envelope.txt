Goal: 
    Create a program that can autogenerate the required unique case files
    for running simulations within a given "flight envelope". This envelope is 
    based off the user inputs for Mach number (Ma) and altitude (h). User will also be 
    required to enter inputs for mesh fidelity (f), and runtime (t) 
    (possibly make these optional parameters with default values).

    In order to the deliver on the idea of flight envelope,
    User will also have the option to insert Ma and h as a range of values. 

    The program will then produce U unique cases to simulate.  

                    where U := M x N , M & N >= 1 

    where M is the number of Ma values provided, and N is the number of h values provided (ints).

Pseudocode (for Python):

        Instantiate required data structures.
            a. template case - case we copy and edit values of. 
            b. pandas.DataFrame - data structure used to store all the data and meta data
                                  for the produced cases. Will approx have shape of (U, n_features)

        Read in user input for Ma and h

    Nested loop | for each U, 

        Calculate required parameters, and store in the correct record. 
            a. rho(h) - density -> numerical density ? Re, Kn
            b. T(h) - temperature
            c. u(Ma) - velocity 
            d. P(h) is possibe. 
            e. mu(?) - viscocity ?????
            e. Re(rho, u, etc.)
            f. Kn(rho, L?)
        
        Make a copy of the template case with the values replaced
        Produce the data needed to run the geometry study produced by Guo and Luo.
